## Dependencies


```sh
# For non-Debian, replace apt with your package manager
sudo apt install xclip rofi
```

* `xclip` lets us copy to clipboard.
* `rofi` works like dmenu, but supports large input.

## Emojis

First, you decide which emojis and keywords you want via a simple text file. E.g.

```
‚ú® sparkles stars magic
üßô mage wizard magician
üåç globe earth europe africa
```

To start with **all emojis** try this:

```sh
curl -s 'https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/11.0/emoji-test.txt' \
  | grep -oP '(?<=   #).*' \
  > ~/.emoji-menu-db
```

The `$EMOJI_MENU_DB` environment variable defaults to `~/.emoji-menu-db`.


## Install

Once you have your emojis, install [`emoji-menu`](https://github.com/jchook/emoji-menu/blob/master/bin/emoji-menu) to your `$PATH`.

```sh
wget 'https://bit.ly/emoji-menu'
chmod +x emoji-menu
sudo mv emoji-menu /usr/local/bin
```

Alternatively you could clone the git repository and add its `bin` folder to your `$PATH`.


## Hotkeys

You definitely want this bad boy on a [hotkey](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Keyboard_shortcuts#Customization), e.g. <kbd>Mod</kbd> + <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd>.

#### Generic

For a solution that works on most window managers, try [xbindkeys](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xbindkeys). In your config:

```sh
"emoji-menu"
  control+alt + x
```

#### Xmonad

If you use Xmonad as your window manager, set [keys](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-0.15/docs/XMonad-Core.html#t:XConfig) [config](https://github.com/vicfryzel/xmonad-config/blob/85c2ca392125ade3bb122e72a99af640896a0727/xmonad.hs#L160-L162) like so:

```haskell
  -- Emoji Menu
 , ((modMask .|. controlMask, xK_x),
    spawn "emoji-menu")
```

#### i3

For i3 add a [bindsym](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#keybindings) to your [config](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#configuring):

```sh
bindsym $mod+Control+x emoji-menu
```
