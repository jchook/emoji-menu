# üé© Emoji Menu

Easily find and copy emojis on Linux. ü•≥


![Demo](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/3F2e2K433s0T301d0Z0n/Peek%202019-01-04%2019-05%20take%205.gif?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=152352&v=a32b86c6)


## ‚ú® Install

Simply install `emoji-menu` to your `$PATH`:

```sh
wget 'https://bit.ly/emoji-menu'
chmod +x emoji-menu
sudo mv emoji-menu /usr/local/bin
```

Be sure to install the dependencies as well

```sh
# For non-Debian, replace apt with your package manager (e.g. yum)
sudo apt install rofi xclip xdotool wget grep coreutils
```

* `rofi` works like dmenu, but supports large input.
* `xclip` lets us copy to clipboard.
* `xdotool` lets us type the result.
* You already have `wget`, `grep`, and `coreutils`.


## üë®‚Äçüé§ Emojis

By default the program automatically downloads *all emojis* on first run.

The `$EMOJI_MENU_DB` environment variable defaults to `~/.emoji-menu-db`.

To customize, store one emoji per line with its keywords, e.g.

```
‚ú® sparkles stars magic
üßô mage wizard magician
üåç globe earth europe africa
```

Pretty simple! You can add other strings too. They don't have to be emojis.

## üßô Options

When invoking `emoji-menu`, you may pass the following options:

* `-f <filename>` - Use a custom emoji database
* `-c <command>` - Run a custom command on emoji choices
* `-t` - Simulate typing the emoji choice using the keyboard


## *Ô∏è‚É£ Hotkeys

You definitely want `emoji-menu` on a [hotkey](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Keyboard_shortcuts#Customization).

In the examples below, I assign <kbd>Mod</kbd> + <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd>.

#### Generic

For a solution that works on most window managers, try [xbindkeys](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xbindkeys). In your config:

```sh
"emoji-menu"
  control+alt + x
```

#### Xmonad

If you use Xmonad as your window manager, set [keys](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-0.15/docs/XMonad-Core.html#t:XConfig) [config](https://github.com/vicfryzel/xmonad-config/blob/85c2ca392125ade3bb122e72a99af640896a0727/xmonad.hs#L160-L162) like so:

```haskell
  -- Emoji Menu
 , ((modMask .|. controlMask, xK_x),
    spawn "emoji-menu")
```

#### i3wm

For i3 add a [bindsym](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#keybindings) to your [config](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#configuring):

```sh
bindsym $mod+Control+x emoji-menu
```

#### Other

If none of the above works for you, please open an [issue](https://github.com/jchook/emoji-menu/issues/new).

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you

Thank you for checking out `emoji-menu`. I enjoy using it and hope you do too.
